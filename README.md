## Complex-Network-Project
Complex network simulation for a school project

## Idea
The idea of this project is to create a complex network using python webscrapper and looking at the Youtube's recommendations on selected video.

#
1'st case: the videos by themselves will be linked (ie. two different videos will have the same video recommendations)

#
2'nd case: the videos won't be linked in any way, (the solution may be to classify them by their creator's channel, then maybe we'll find some connections)
